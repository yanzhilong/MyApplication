是不是疯了
新概念英语








Aeroplanes are slowly driving me mad. |I live near an airport and passing planes can be heard night and day. |The airport was built years ago, |but for some reason it could not be used then. |Last year, however, it came into use. |Over a hundred people must have been driven away from their homes by the noise. |I am one of the few people left. |Sometimes I think this house will be knocked down by a passing plane. |I have been offered a large sum of money to go away, |but I am determined to stay here. |Everybody says I must be mad and they are probably right.

飞机正在逐渐把我逼疯。|我住在一个机场附近，过往飞机日夜不绝于耳。|机场是许多年前建的，|但由于某种原因当时未能启用。|然而去年机场开始使用了。|有100多人肯定是被噪音逼得已经弃家远去，|我是少数留下来的人中的一个。|有时我觉得这房子就要被一架飞过的飞机撞倒。|他们曾向我提供一大笔钱让我搬走，|但我决定留在这儿。|大家都说我肯定是疯了，也许他们说的是对的。
