新概念英语

I crossed the street to avoid meeting him, but he saw me and came running towards me. It was no use pretending that I had not seen him, so I waved to him. I never enjoy meeting Nigel Dykes.

No, not at all,' I answered. 'I'm going to...'
Would you mind my coming with you?' he asked, before I had finished speaking.
Not at all,' I lied, 'but I'm going to the dentist.'
Then I'll come with you,' he answered. 'There's always plenty to read in the waiting room!

我穿过马路以便避开他，但他看到我并朝我跑过来。若再装作没看见他已是没有用了，我只好向他招手。我就怕遇到奈杰尔.戴克斯。他从来都是无事可做，不管你多忙，他总是坚持要跟你去。我得想办法不让他整个上午缠着我。
你好，奈杰尔，想不到在这儿见到你。”我说。
你好，伊丽莎白，”奈杰尔回答说，“我正不知道怎么消磨这一上午呢，正好见到好。你不忙，是吗？”
不，不忙，我打算去......”我回答。
我跟你一道去行吗？”没等我说完话他就问道。
没关系，但我准备去牙医那里。”我说了个谎。
那我也跟你去，候诊室里总有很多东西可供阅读！”他回答。
