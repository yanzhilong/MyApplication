How long had the police taken to find his bicycle?







Dan Robinson has been worried all week. Last Tuesday he received a letter from the local police. In the letter he was asked to call at the station. Dan wondered why he was wanted by the police, but he went to the station yesterday and now he is not worried anymore. At the station, he was told by a smiling policeman that his bicycle had been found. Five days ago, the policeman told him, the bicycle was picked up in a small village four hundred miles away. It is now being sent to his home by train. Dan was most surprised when he heard the news. He was amused too, because he never expected the bicycle to be found. It was stolen twenty years ago when Dan was a boy of fifteen!








丹.鲁宾逊焦虑了整整一个星期。上星期二他收到当地警察局的一封信，要他到警察局去一趟。丹奇怪警察为什么找他，但昨天还是去了，结果他一再担心了。在警察局里，一位面带笑容的警察告诉他，他的自行车找到了。那位警察对他说，那辆自行车是5天前在400英里外的一个小村里发现的，现在正用火车给他运回家来。丹听到这个消息后，惊奇万分，但又感到非常好笑，因为他从未指望那辆自行车还能找到。这是20年前丹还是一个15岁的孩子时被人偷走的！
