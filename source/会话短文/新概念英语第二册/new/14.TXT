Lesson 14 Do you speak English?
你会讲英语吗？
新概念英语

I had an amusing experience last year. |After I had left a small village in the south of France, |I drove on to the next town. |On the way, |a young man waved to me. |I stopped and he asked me for a lift. |As soon as he had got into the car, |I said good morning to him in French and he replied in the same language. |Apart from a few words, |I do not know any French at all. |Neither of us spoke during the journey. |I had nearly reached the town, |when the young man suddenly said, |very slowly, |"Do you speak English?' |As I soon learnt, he was English himself!'

去年我有过一次有趣的经历。|在离开法国南部的一个小村庄后，|我继续驶往下一个城镇。|途中，|一个青年人向我招手。|我把车停下，他向我提出要求搭车。|他一上车，|我就用法语向他问早上好，他也同样用法语回答我。|除了个别几个单词外，|我根本不会法语。|旅途中我们谁也没讲话。|就要到达那个镇时，|那青年突然开了口，|慢慢地说道：|“你会讲英语吗？”
|我很快了解到，|他自己就是个英国人！
