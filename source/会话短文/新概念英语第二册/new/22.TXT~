My daughter, Jane, never dreamed of receiving a letter from a girl of her own age in Holland. |Last year, |we were travelling across the Channel and Jane put a piece of paper with her name and address on it into a bottle. |She threw the bottle into the sea. |She never thought of it again, |but ten months later, |she received a letter from a girl in Holland. |Both girls write to each other regularly now. |However, they have decided to use the post office. |Letters will cost a little more, |but they will certainly travel faster.

我的女儿简从未想过会接到荷兰一位同龄姑娘的来信。|去年，|当我们横渡英吉利海峡时，简把写有她姓名和住址的一张纸条装进了一只瓶子，|又将瓶子扔进了大海。|此后她就再没去想那只瓶子。|但10个月以后，|她收到了荷兰一位姑娘的来信。|现在这两位姑娘定期通信了。|然而她们还是决定利用邮局。|这样会稍微多花点钱，|但肯定是快得多了。
