Lesson 25 Do the English speak English? 
英国人讲的是英语吗？
新概念英语








I arrived in London at last. |The railway station was big, |black and dark. |I did not know the way to my hotel, |so I asked a porter. |I not only spoke English very carefully, |but very clearly as well. The porter, |however, could not understand me. |I repeated my question several times and at last he understood. |he answered me, |but he spoke neither slowly nor clearly. |'I am a foreigner,' I said. |Then he spoke slowly, |but I could not understand him. |My teacher never spoke English like that! |The porter and I looked at each other and smiled. |Then he said something and I understood it. |'You'll soon learn English!' he said. |I wonder. |In England, |each person speaks a different language. |The English understand each other, |but I don't understand them! |Do they speak English?

我终于到了伦敦。|火车站很大，|又黑又暗。|我不知道去饭店的路该怎么走，|于是向一个搬运工打听。|我的英语讲得不但非常认真，|而且咬字也非常清楚。|然而搬运工却不明白我的话。|我把问话重复了很多遍。他终于听懂了。|他回答了，|但他讲得既不慢也不清楚。|“我是个外国人，”我说。|于是他说得慢了，|可我还是听不懂。|我的老师从来不那样讲英语！|我和搬运工相视一笑。|接着，他说了点什么，这回我听懂了。|“您会很快学会英语的！”他说。|我感到奇怪。|在英国，|人们各自说着一种不同的语言。|英国人之间相互听得懂，|可我却不懂他们的话！|他们说的是英语吗？
