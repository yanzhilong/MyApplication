新概念英语

The play may begin at any moment,' I said.
It may have begun already,' Susan answered.
I hurried to the ticket office. 'May I have two tickets please?' I asked.
I'm sorry, we've sold out,' the girl said.
What a pity!' Susan exclaimed.
Just then, a man hurried to the ticket office.
Can I return these two tickets?' he asked.
Certainly,' the girl said.
I went back to the ticket office at once.
Could I have those two tickets please?' I asked.
Certainly,' the girl said, 'but they're for next Wednesday's performance. Do you still want them?'
I might as well have them,' I said sadly.

剧马上就要开演了，”我说。
也许已经开演了呢，”苏珊回答说。
我匆匆赶到售票处，问：“我可以买两张票吗？”
对不起，票已售完。”那位姑娘说。
真可惜！”苏珊大声说。
正在这时，一个男子匆匆奔向售票处。
我可以退掉这两张票吗？”他问。
当然可以，”那姑娘说。
我马上又回到售票处。
我可以买那两张票吗？”我问。
当然可以，不过这两张票是下星期三的，您是否还要呢？”
我还是买下的好，”我垂头丧气地说。
