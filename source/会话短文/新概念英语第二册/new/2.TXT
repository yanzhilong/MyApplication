First listen and then answer the question.



听录音，然后回答以下问题。



Why was the writer's aunt surprised?







It was Sunday. I never get up early on Sundays. I sometimes stay in bed until lunchtime. Last Sunday I got up very late. I looked out of the window. It was dark outside. 'What a day!' I thought. 'It's raining again.' Just then, the telephone rang. It was my aunt Lucy. 'I've just arrived by train,' she said. 'I'm coming to see you.'



'But I'm still having breakfast,' I said.



'What are you doing?' she asked.



'I'm having breakfast,' I repeated.



'Dear me,' she said. 'Do you always get up so late? It's one o'clock!'








那是个星期天，而在星期天我是从来不早起的，有时我要一直躺到吃午饭的时候。上个星期天，我起得很晚。我望望窗外，外面一片昏暗。“鬼天气！”我想，“又下雨了。”正在这时，电话铃响了。是我姑母露西打来的。“我刚下火车，”她说，“我这就来看你。”

“但我还在吃早饭，”我说。

“你在干什么？”她问道。

“我正在吃早饭，”我又说了一遍。

“天啊，”她说，“你总是起得这么晚吗？现在已经1点钟了！”
