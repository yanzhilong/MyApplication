    听录音，然后回答以下问题。
    What was the good news?

    The secretary told me that Mr. Harmsworth would see me. I felt very nervous when I went into his office. He did not look up from his desk when I entered. After I had sat down, he said that business was very bad. He told me that the firm could not afford to pay such large salaries. Twenty people had already left. I knew that my turn had come.
    'Mr.Harmsworth,' I said in a weak voice.
    'Don't interrupt,' he said.
    Then he smiled and told me I would receive an extra thousand pounds a year!

    秘书告诉我说哈姆斯沃斯先生要见我。我走进他的办公室，感到非常紧张。我进去的时候，他连头也没抬。待我坐下后，他说生意非常不景气。他还告诉我，公司支付不起这么庞大的工资开支，有20个人已经离去。我知道这次该轮到我了。
    “哈姆斯沃斯先生，”我无力地说。
    “不要打断我的话，”他说。
     然后他微笑了一下告诉我说，我每年将得到1,000 英镑的额外收入。
