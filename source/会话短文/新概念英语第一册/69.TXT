听录音，然后回答问题。哪辆车在1995年的比赛中获胜？

    There is a car race near our town every year. In 1995, there was a very big race.
    There were hundreds of people there. My wife and I were at the race. Our friends Julie and Jack were there, too. You can see us in the crowd. We are standing on the left.
    There were twenty cars in the race. There were English cars, French cares, German cars. Italian cars. American cars and Japanese cars.
    It was an exciting finish. The winner was Billy Stewart. He was in car number fifteen. Five other cars were just behind him.
     On the way home, my wife said to me, 'Don't drive so quickly! You're not Billy Stewart!'
