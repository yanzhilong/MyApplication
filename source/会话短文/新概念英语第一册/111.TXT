Listen to the tape then answer this question. Can Mr. Frith buy the television on instalments? How does it work?
听录音，然后回答问题。弗里斯先生可以用分期付款方式购买电视机吗？如何操作呢？

MR. FRITH: I like television very much.
           How much does it cost?
ASSISTANT: It's the most expensive 
           model in the shop.
           It costs five hundred pounds.
MR. FRITH: That's too expensive for us.
           We can't afford all that
           money.
ASSISTANT: This model's less expensive
           than that one.
           It's only three hundred 
           pounds. But, of course,
           it's not as good as the 
           expensive one.
MR. FRITH: I don't like the model.
           The other model's more 
           expensive, but it's 
           worth the money.
MR. FRITH: Can we buy it on instalments?
ASSISTANT: Of course.
           You can pay a deposit of 
           thirty pounds, and then 
           fourteen pounds a month for 
           three years.
MR. FRITH: Do you like it, dear?
MRS. FRITH:I certainly do,
           but I don't like the price.
           You always want the best,
           but we can't afford it.
           Sometimes you think 
           you're a millionaire!
MR. FRITH: Millionaires don't buy 
           things on instalments!

弗里斯先生：我非常喜欢这台电视机。
            请问它多少钱？
店      员：这是店里最贵的型号。
            它的售价是500英镑。
弗里斯夫人：这对我们来说是太贵了。
            我们花不起那么多钱。
店      员：这种型号比那种要便宜些。
            它只要300英镑。但是，
            它当然没有价钱高那种好。
弗里斯先生：我不喜欢这种型号。
            那种型号价格是贵一些，
            但它值得那么多钱。
弗里斯先生：我们可以用分期付款的方式]
            购买吗？
店      员：当然可以。您可以先付30英镑
            定金，然后每月14镑,3年付清。
弗里斯先生：你喜欢吗，亲爱的？
弗里斯夫人：我当然喜欢，但是我不喜欢这
            个价钱。你总是要买最好的，
            可我们买不起，有时候你认
            为自己是个百万富翁！
弗里斯先生：百万富翁是不会分期付款
            买东西的！
