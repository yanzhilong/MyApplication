听录音，然后回答问题。为什么这位男士需要一本常用语手册？

    Last week Mrs. Mills went to London. She does not know London very well, and she lost her way.
    Suddenly, she saw a man near a bus stop. 'I can ask him the way.' she said to herself.
    'Excuse me,' she said. 'Can you tell me the way to King Street, please?'
    The man smiled pleasantly. He did not understand English! He spoke German. He was a tourist.
    Then he put his hand into pocket, and took out a phrasebook.
    He opened the book and found a phrase. He read the phrase slowly. 'I am sorry,' he said. 'I do not speak English.'

    上星期米尔斯夫人去了伦敦。她对伦敦不很熟悉，因此迷了路。
    突然，她在公共汽车站附近看到一个男人。“我可以向他问路，”她想。
    “对不起，您能告诉我到国王街怎么走吗？”她说。
    这人友好地笑了笑。他不懂英语！他讲德语。他是个旅游者。
    然后他把手伸进了衣袋，掏出了一本常用语手册。
    他翻开书找到了一条短语。他缓慢地读着短语。
    ”很抱歉，“他说，”我不会讲英语。”
