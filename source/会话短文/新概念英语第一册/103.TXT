           The French test
             法语考试 

Listen to the tape then answer this question. How long did the exam last?
听录音，然后回答问题。 考试持续了多长时间？

GARY:    How was the exam, Richard?
RICHARD: Not too bad.
         I think I passed in
         English and Mathematics.
         The questions were very easy.
         How about you, Gary?
GARY:    The English and Maths papers
         weren't easy enough for me.
         I hope I haven't failed.
RICHARD: I think I failed the French 
         paper.
         I could answer sixteen of 
         the question.
         They were very easy.
         But I couldn't answer the rest.
         They were too difficult for me.
GARY:    French test are awful, aren't 
         they?
RICHARD: I hate them.
         I'm sure I've got a low mark.
GARY:    Oh, cheer up!
         perhaps we didn't to do badly.
         The guy next to me
         Wrote his name 
         at the top of the paper.
RICHARD: Yes?
GARY:    Then he sat there
         and looked at it for three 
         hours! He didn't write a word!

参考译文 

加  里：考试考得怎样，理查德？
理查德：不算太坏，我想我的英语和数学 
        及格了。题目很容易。加里，
        你怎么样？
加  里：英语和数学试题对我来说不很容易。
        我希望别不及格。
理查德：我想我的法语及不了格，我能回答
        其中的16道题。这些题很容易。
        但我回答不出其作的题。那些题对
        我来说太难了。
加  里：法语太可怕了，你说呢？
理查德：我讨厌法语。我的法语成绩肯定
        很低。
加  里：啊，别灰心！或许我们考得还不太
        糟。坐在我旁边的那个人只在试卷
        顶端写自己的名字。
理查德：是吗？
加  里：然后他就坐在那里，对着考卷看了3
        个小时，一个字也没写！
