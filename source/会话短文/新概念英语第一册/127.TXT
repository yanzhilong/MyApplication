             Lesson 127
            A famous actress 
               著名的女演员

Listen to the tape then answer this question. Who is only twenty-nine, and why is it so unclear?
听录音，然后回答问题。谁只有29岁？为什么这件事如此含糊不清？
 
KATE: Can you recognize that woman,
      Liz?
LIZ:  I think I can, Kate.
      It must be Karen Marsh,
      the actress.
KATE: I though so.
      Who's that beside her?
LIZ:  That must be Conrad Reeves.
KATE: Conrad Reeves, the actor?
      It's can't be.
      Let me have another look.
      I think you're right!
      Isn't he her third husband?
LIZ:  No. He must be her fourth or
      fifth.
KATE: Doesn't Karen Marsh look old!
LIZ:  She does, doesn't she!
      I read she's twenty-nine,
      but she must be at least forty.
KATE: I'm sure she is.
LIZ:  She was a famous actress
      When I was still at school.
KATE: That was a long time ago,
      wasn't it?
LIZ:  Not that long ago!
      I'm not more than twenty-nine
      myself.
