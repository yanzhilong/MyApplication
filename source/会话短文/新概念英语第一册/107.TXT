Listen to the tape then answer this question. What kind of dress does the lady want?
听录音，然后回答问题。 这位女士想要什么样的服装？
 
ASSISTANT: Do you like this dress,
           madam?
LADY:      I like the colour very much.
           It's lovely dress,
           but it's too small for me.
ASSISTANT: What about this one?
           It's lovely dress.
           It's very smart.
           Short skirts are in fashion
           now.
           Would you like to try it?
LADY:      All right.
LADY:      I'm afraid this green dress
           it too small for me as well.
           It's smaller than the blue 
           one.
LADY:      I don't like the colour
           either. It doesn't suit me 
           at all. I think the blue 
           dress is prettier.
LADY:      Could you show me another
           blue dress? I want a dress
           like that one, but it must
           be my size.
ASSISTANT: I'm afraid I haven't got 
           a larger dress.
           This is the largest dress 
           in the shop.

店员：夫人，您喜欢这件衣服吗？
女士：我很喜欢这颜色。这件漂亮的衣服，
      可是对我来说太小了。
店员：这件怎么样？这是件漂亮的衣服，
      它很时髦。短裙现在很流行。
      您要试一试吗？
女士：好吧。
店员：恐怕这件绿色的我穿着也太小了。
      它比那件蓝色的还要小。
女士：我也不喜欢这种颜色。这颜色我穿
      根本不合适。我认为那件蓝色的更
      漂亮些。
女士：您能再给我看一件蓝色的吗？
      我想一件和那件一样的，
      但必须是我的尺寸。
店员：恐怕没有更大的了。
      这是店里最大一件。
