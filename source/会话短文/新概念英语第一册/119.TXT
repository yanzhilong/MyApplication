    Do you like stories? I want to tell you a true story. It happened to a friend of mine a year ago.
    While my friend, George, was reading in bed, two thieves climbed into his kitchen.
    After they had entered the house, they went into the dining room. It was very dark, so they turned on a torch.
    Suddenly, they heard a voice behind them. "What's up? What's up?" someone called. The thieves dropped the torch and ran away as quickly as they could.
    George heard the noise and came downstairs quickly.
    He turned on the light, but he couldn't see anyone. The thieves had already gone.
    But George's parrot, Henry, was still there. "What's up, George?" the called. 'Nothing, Henry,' George said and smiled. 'Go back to sleep.'

    你喜欢听故事吗？我要告诉你一个真实的故事。这是一年前发生在我的一个朋友身上的故事。
    当我的朋友乔治在床上看书时，两个小偷爬进了他的厨房。
    他们进到屋里后，走进了饭厅。饭厅很暗，于是他们打开了手电筒。
    突然他们听到身后有声音。“什么事？什么事？”有人叫着。小偷扔下了手电筒，飞快地逃走了。
    乔治听到了响声，迅速地下了楼。
    他开了灯，但不见一个人。小偷逃走了。
    但时乔治的鹦鹉亨利仍在那里。“什么事，乔治？”它叫着。“没事，亨利。”乔治笑着说，“接着睡觉吧。”
