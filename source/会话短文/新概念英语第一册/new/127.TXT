凯特：莉兹，你能认出那个女人吗？





LIZ: I think I can, Kate.



It must be Karen Marsh,

KATE: I though so.



Who's that beside her?



LIZ: That must be Conrad Reeves.



KATE: Conrad Reeves, the actor?


莉兹：我想我认得出来，凯特。那一定是女
演员卡.马会。
凯特：我也这样想。她旁边的那个人是谁？
莉兹：一定是康拉德.里弗斯。
凯特：康拉德.里弗斯，那个男演员吗？
不可能是。让我再看一看。
我想你是对的。他不是她的第3个
丈夫吗？

It's can't be.



Let me have another look.



I think you're right!



Isn't he her third husband?



LIZ: No. He must be her fourth or



fifth.



KATE: Doesn't Karen Marsh look old!



LIZ: She does, doesn't she!



I read she's twenty-nine,



but she must be at least forty.



KATE: I'm sure she is.



LIZ: She was a famous actress



When I was still at school.



KATE: That was a long time ago,



wasn't it?



LIZ: Not that long ago!



I'm not more than twenty-nine



myself.







莉兹：不，他一定是她的第4个或第5个丈夫。
凯特：卡伦看上去不显老嘛！
莉兹：是的，谁说不是呢！我从报上看到她
是29岁，但她一定至少有40岁了。
凯特：我肯定她有40岁了。
莉兹：当我还是学生时，她就是个著名的
演员了。
凯特：那是好久以前的事了。是吗？
莉兹：不，没有那么久。我自己现在还没
29岁呢。
