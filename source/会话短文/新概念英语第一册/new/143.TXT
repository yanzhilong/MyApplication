新概念英语
I live in a very old town which is surrounded by beautiful woods. |It is a famous beauty spot. |On Sundays, |hundreds of people come from the city to see our town and to walk through the woods. |Visitors have been asked to keep the woods clean and tidy. |Litter baskets have been placed under the trees, |but people still throw their rubbish everywhere. |Last Wednesday, I went for a walk in the woods. |What I saw made me very sad. |I counted seven old cars and three old refrigerators. |The little baskets were empty and the ground was covered with pieces of paper, |cigarette ends, |old tyres, |empty bottles and |rusty tins. Among the rubbish, |I found a sign which said, 'Anyone who leaves litter in these woods will be prosecuted!'
