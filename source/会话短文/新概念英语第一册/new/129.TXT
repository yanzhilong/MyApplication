ANN: Look, Gary!



That policeman's waving to



you.



He wants you to stop.



POLICEMAN: Where do you think you are?



On a race track?



You must have been driving



at seventy miles an hour.



GARY: I can't have been.



POLICEMAN: I was doing eighty



when I overtook you.



POLICEMAN: Didn't you see the speed



limit?



GARY: I'm afraid I didn't, officer.



I must have been dreaming.



ANN: He wasn't dreaming, officer.



I was telling him to drive



slowly.



GARY: That's why I didn't see the



sign.



POLICEMAN: Let me see your driving



licence.



POLICEMAN: I won't charge you this time.



But you'd better not do it



again!



GARY: Thank you.



I'll certainly be more



careful.



ANN: I told you to drive slowly,



Gary.



GARY: You always tell me to drive



slowly, darling.



ANN: Well, next time



you'd better take my advice!






安：瞧，加里！那个警察正朝你挥手呢。
他要你停下来。
警察：你认为你现在是在哪儿？
在赛车道上吗？你刚才一定是以每小时
70英里的速度开车。
加里：我不会开得那么快的。
警察：我是以第小时80英里的速度赶上你的。
警察：难道你没看见限速牌吗？
加里：恐怕我没有看见，警官。
我一定思想开小差了。
安：警官，他思想没有开小差。
我刚才正告诉他开慢点。
安里：所以我才没看见那牌子。
警察：让我看一看你的驾驶执照。
警察：这次我就不罚你款了。但你最好不要再
开得这样快。
加里：谢谢您。我以后一定会多加注意。
安：加里，我刚才叫你开慢点吧。
加里：你总是叫我开慢点，亲爱的。
安：好啦，下次你最好还是听从我的劝告！
