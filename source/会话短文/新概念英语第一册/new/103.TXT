GARY: How was the exam, Richard?



RICHARD: Not too bad.



I think I passed in



English and Mathematics.



The questions were very easy.



How about you, Gary?



GARY: The English and Maths papers



weren't easy enough for me.



I hope I haven't failed.



RICHARD: I think I failed the French



paper.



I could answer sixteen of



the question.



They were very easy.



But I couldn't answer the rest.



They were too difficult for me.



GARY: French test are awful, aren't



they?



RICHARD: I hate them.



I'm sure I've got a low mark.



GARY: Oh, cheer up!



perhaps we didn't to do badly.



The guy next to me



Wrote his name



at the top of the paper.



RICHARD: Yes?



GARY: Then he sat there



and looked at it for three



hours! He didn't write a word!






加里：考试考得怎样，理查德？
理查德：不算太坏，我想我的英语和数学
及格了。题目很容易。加里，
你怎么样？
加里：英语和数学试题对我来说不很容易。
我希望别不及格。
理查德：我想我的法语及不了格，我能回答
其中的16道题。这些题很容易。
但我回答不出其作的题。那些题对
我来说太难了。
加里：法语太可怕了，你说呢？
理查德：我讨厌法语。我的法语成绩肯定
很低。
加里：啊，别灰心！或许我们考得还不太
糟。坐在我旁边的那个人只在试卷
顶端写自己的名字。
理查德：是吗？
加里：然后他就坐在那里，对着考卷看了3
个小时，一个字也没写！
