Last week, my four-year-old daughter, Sally, was invited to a children's party. |I decided to take her by train. |Sally was very excited |because she had never travelled on a train before. |She sat near the window and |asked questions about everything she saw. |Suddenly, a middle-age lady got on the train and sat opposite Sally. |'Hello, little girl,' she said. |Sally did not answer, |but looked at her curiously. |The lady was dressed in a blue coat and a large, funny hat. |After the train had left the station, |the lady opened her handbag and took to her power compact. |She then began to make up her face. |'Why are you doing that?' Sally asked. |'To make myself beautiful,' the lady answered. |She put away her compact and smiled kindly. |'But you are still ugly,' Sally said. |Sally was amused, |but I was very embarrassed!

上周，我4岁的女儿萨莉被邀请去参加一个儿童聚会。|我决定带她乘火车去。|萨莉非常激动，|因为她从未乘过火车。|她靠车窗坐着，|对她所看到的一切都要问个明白。|突然，一个中年妇女上了火车，坐在萨莉的对面。|“你好，小姑娘，”她说。|萨莉没回答，|却好奇地看着她。|那位妇女穿着一件蓝色的大衣，戴着一顶大而滑稽的帽子。|火车开出车站后，|那位妇女找开了手提包，拿出了粉盒。|然后她开始打扮起来。|“你为什么要那样做呢？”萨莉问。|“为了把自己打扮漂亮啊，”那位妇女答道。|她放好了粉盒，慈祥地微笑着。|“可是你仍然难看呀，”萨莉说。|萨莉感到很有趣，|而我却很尴尬。
