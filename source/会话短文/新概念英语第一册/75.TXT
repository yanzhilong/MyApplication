LADY:           Do you have any shoes 
                like these?
SHOP ASSISTANT: What size?
LADY:           Black.
SHOP ASSISTANT: I'm sorry.
                We don't have any.
LADY:           But my sister bought
                this pair last month.
SHOP ASSISTANT: Did she buy them here?
LADY:           No, she bought them
                in the U.S.
SHOP ASSISTANT: We had some shoes like 
                those a month ago,
                but we don't have any
                now.
LADY:           Can you get a pair for 
                me, please?
SHOP ASSISTANT: I'm afraid that I can't.

                last year and the year
                before last.
                But they're not in  
                fashion this year.
SHOP ASSISTANT: These shoes are in 
                fashion now.
LADY:           They look very 
                uncomfortable.
SHOP ASSISTANT: They are very 
                uncomfortable. But
                women always wear
                uncomfortable shoes!

        一双。
