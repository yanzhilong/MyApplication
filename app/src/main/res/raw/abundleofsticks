A Bundle of Sticks
一捆树枝
那些给我智慧和勇气的寓言故事87
A man once had four sons who never stopped quarrelling with one another.

从前有一个人，他有四个儿子，但儿子们不断地争吵。

He was always telling them how much easier life would be if they worked together |but they took absolutely no notice of him.

他一再告诫他们说，如果他们一起干活儿，生活会舒适得多，|但他们丝毫不理会他的意见。

One day he decided to show them what he meant.

有一天，他决定通过示范把自己的意思告诉他们。

He called all the sons together, |and put a tightly tied bundle of sticks on the floor in front of them.

他把四个儿子都叫来，|又把一捆扎得很紧的树枝放在他们面前。

"Can you break that?" |he asked the youngest son. |The boy put his knee on the bundle but though he pressed and pulled with his arms he could not bend the wood.

“你能折断这个吗？|他问最小的儿子。|小儿子用膝盖顶住，两只手又压又拉，都不能把那捆树枝弄弯。

The father asked each son in turn to try to break the bundle, |but none of them could do it .

父亲让另外三个儿子挨个儿试了试，|但他们谁也做不到。

Then he untied the string and scattered the sticks.

然后，他解开绳子，把树枝撒开。

"Now try,"he said. |The boys broke the sticks easily in their hands.

¨现在试试吧。¨他说。|四个小伙子用手轻轻一撅，树枝就断了。

"Do you see what I mean?" asked the father. |"If only you stand together no one can hurt you. |If you all disagree the whole time and insist on going your separate ways, |the first enemy you meet will be able to destroy you.'

“你们明白我的意思了吗？”父亲问，|“只要你们联合起来，谁也不能伤害你们。|如果你们老吵架，坚持各行其是，|那么你们一遇到敌人，就会被打败。”
