    Displaying large amounts of data in an Android app can be a tricky balancing act. Even on devices with larger screens (such as a laptop or computer) being confronted with a solid wall of data isn’t particularly appealing!

Android provides several UI components that can help you bring instant structure and design to even the largest data sets, so you can deliver data-packed screens that users won’t mind scrolling through.
